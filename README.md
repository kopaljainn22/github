# github
notes by me 
git add : takes a modified file in your working directory and places the modified version in a staging area. git commit takes everything from the staging area and makes a permanent snapshot of the current state of your repository that is associated with a unique identifier.
Commits are the core building block units of a Git project timeline. Commits can be thought of as snapshots or milestones along the timeline of a Git project. Commits are created with the git commit command to capture the state of a project at that point in time.
